# Dimensional Explorations

A multi-section webpage showcasing theoretical concepts with a visually engaging design, featuring an interactive 3D background using Three.js and scroll animations with GSAP.

## Files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the page and linking to the CSS and JavaScript.
- `style.css`: Contains all the CSS styling, including custom properties and responsive design rules.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code that creates the 3D background, handles animations using GSAP/ScrollTrigger, and manages mouse and click interactions.

## Setup:

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Ensure you have an internet connection to load the Three.js and GSAP libraries from their CDNs as linked in `index.html`.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

The JavaScript code initializes a 3D scene with a cube and particle system that responds to scrolling and mouse movements. GSAP and ScrollTrigger are used to animate the text elements and the 3D scene as you scroll down the page.
