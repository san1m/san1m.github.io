                <p class="description">In the quiet whispers of longing's embrace,<br>Emotions dance, a silent symphony in space.<br>Soft mumbles weave through hues of desire,<br>Yet shackles bind, extinguishing warmth's fire.<br><br>Numbness consumes, distances unfurl,<br>Leaving behind fragments, a scattered whirl.<br>Concealed, these pieces, I leave in my wake,<br>Hoping love's essence forever to take.</p>

                <p class="description">In muted tones, anxiety takes its stand,<br>soft shadows weave through life's chaotic band.<br>desires seek elusive serenity's embrace,<br>amidst the symphony, a yearning trace.<br><br>stumbled upon a soothing essence rare,<br>whispering serenity, a breath of air.<br>in the corners of my soul, it finds its place,<br>lifting gracefully from the abyss, a gentle grace.<br><br>a force cradles my descent, so tender,<br>into the realms of grace, a sweet surrender.<br>a hidden gem within life's tapestry,<br>love discovered, serendipitously.</p>

                <p class="description">The rain fell soft, a silver lace,<br>Upon the earth’s quiet, tender face.<br>And in that hush, where hearts confess,<br>I found your eyes, and nothing less.<br><br>Beneath the sky, so vast and gray,<br>We didn’t speak, but let it play—<br>The rhythm of the falling mist,<br>A symphony, in every kiss.<br><br>The world was wet with storm and grace,<br>But all I saw was your sweet face.<br>You held my hand, and time stood still,<br>As if the stars bent to our will.<br><br>Each drop that danced on leaf and skin<br>Was love’s own hymn, soft and thin—<br>A vow the night wrote on the air,<br>Of all the moments we would share.<br><br>So if it rains when you feel low,<br>Remember that I’ll always show—<br>To walk with you through storm or shine,<br>Because you’re forever—forever mine.</p>
